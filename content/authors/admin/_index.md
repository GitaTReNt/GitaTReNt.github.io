## Biography

Hi, I‚Äôm an undergraduate student in Artificial Intelligence at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, with a strong enthusiasm for advancing science through innovative AI models and practical applications.
Throughout my academic journey, I‚Äôve actively engaged in research that pushes the boundaries of AI in healthcare. Currently, I‚Äôm working as a visiting student at Peking University, leading a project on EEG-based cross-patient seizure classification with the help of Dr. Haoxuan Li. Our work focuses on innovating invariant spatiotemporal representation learning to enhance model robustness across different patient datasets. Our recent findings were recognized at NeuroAI @ NeurIPS 2024, an event organized by Yoshua Bengio, a pioneer in the deep learning field and a 2018 Turing Award recipient. Being acknowledged at such a prestigious venue has been a rewarding milestone in my research career.
